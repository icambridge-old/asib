ASIB - A Scala IRC Bot
======================

This is a simple IRC bot, purpose is a simple project which I can do to learn all the functionality
of Scala. It'll be rather rudimentary and hopefully after a while contain all the functionality
that Scala has. It should not be used in a production environment.

# Disclosure

I stole the original part of the base connection from
http://forum.swiftirc.net/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=21904. Which as you can see is the bare bones
connection stuff.
